1. HOW WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR INFORMATION

We collect the following types of information about you:
Information you provide us directly — We ask for certain information such as your name and e-mail address if you register for a User account with the Service, or if you correspond with us (in which case we will also retain our responses). If you purchase products or services or sign up for a paid subscription, then we will also ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you create, share, or post to the Service, which may include information contained in your profile as well as photos or other image files and associated metadata. If you sign up for our e-mail mailing list, we will collect your name and e-mail address. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.

Information we may receive from third parties — We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the Generate  application, linking your account to the Generate  Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Generate . This information could include, but is not limited to any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. We may use this information to find your contacts on the Service, to let you know what your contacts are doing on the Service, and to let your contacts know what you are doing on the Service. We may also use it to suggest additional users or friends you may want to follow or connect with. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to Generate ’s websites or Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.

Inviting a third party to use our Service — If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service, we will ask you for that person’s email address or phone number, or with your permission we may access and store your contact list available on your mobile device, and we will automatically send an email invitation to the invitee. After sending the invitation, we may also send reminder emails to your invitees on your behalf. We store this information to send this email, to register the invitee if your invitation is accepted, to track the success of our invitation service, and to let you know when your contacts join the Service. Unless the invitee becomes a registered User of the Service, we do not use the invitee’s email address for marketing purposes, and we do not share the invitee’s email address with third parties other than Generate ’s service providers. The invitee may contact us at any time to request that we remove his or her information from our database in this form.
Metadata — We may collect metadata associated with User Content. Metadata typically consists of how, when, where and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content has been formatted. Users can add or may have added metadata added to their User Content including keywords posted with a photo or video, including names, geographical or location information, comments or other data. This makes your data more searchable and more interactive. However, the metadata may be accessible to others if you share the User Content with others or on third party social media sites.

We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. We may also use this information to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.
Use of cookies and other technology to collect information. We automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our website or use our Service.
Analytics information — We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including the web pages you visit, your browser add-ons, your browser’s width and height, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We may collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.

Cookies information — When you visit the Service, we and our third party partners may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Generate  help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. You can find out more about our use of cookies and similar technologies in our Cookie Policy.
Log file information — Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
Clear gifs/web beacons information — When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users anonymously. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our Users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.

Device identifiers — When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets) or computer, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Generate . A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

Location data — When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.

Ads on our Service — We may permit third party online advertising networks to collect information about your use of our website over time so that they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests on our Service or on other websites or services. Typically, these third-party ad servers or ad networks use cookies and other tracking technology to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service and on other sites around the Web, to send you the ads that appear on the Service, to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. The Generate  Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. For more information about your choices regarding the use of your personal information for online advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.
We use or may use the data collected through cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including advertising; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (h) track User Content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; and (i) to provide advertising to your browser or device. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our visitors, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time.

1.3 Third Party Accounts. To the extent permitted by the function of the Services, you may link your Account with or register your Account using a valid account on a social networking service or on the app store or marketplace from which you downloaded the Mobile Software (e.g. Apple App Store, Google Play store, etc.) through which you have connected to the Services (each such account, a “Third-Party Account”). By connecting your Third-Party Accounts you are allowing Generate to access your Third-Party Account as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to Generate and/or grant Generate access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for the purposes described herein) without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Generate to pay any fees or making Generate subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers. By granting Generate access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that Generate may access, make available and store (if applicable) any information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags and/or other materials accessible through the Services that you have provided to and stored in such Third-Party Account (“SNS Content”) so that it is available on and through the Services via your Account. Unless otherwise specified in the Agreement, all SNS Content shall be considered to be your User Content (as defined in Section 2.1) for all purposes of the Agreement. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose to connect to the Services and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts may be available on and through your Account. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Generate’s access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by you or the third-party service provider, then your Account and SNS Content may no longer be available on and through the Services. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Account and your Third-Party Accounts by accessing the applicable account settings page on the Third-Party Account. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND GENERATE IS NOT LIABLE FOR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO IT BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS IN VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET IN SUCH THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS.

Summary: Use of our services by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited.



If you want to use our services, you must be able to legally agree to these terms.

We are excited that you want to use Generate, but you need to create your own account. The information associated with your account must be accurate and up-to-date, and you can always change your account information through your settings page. Generate isn’t responsible if someone else uses your account. Oh, and one more thing, don’t use someone else’s account, get your own, and don’t share your login credentials with anyone else!

If you connect your Generate account to a third-party service, you agree to let Generate access the stuff in your third-party account in accordance with your settings on that service and use it to provide our services to you. Generate is not responsible for your use of any third-party services or for any of your stuff the third-party service shares with us.

There are some ground rules you must abide by that are intended to protect our services and the Generate community. For example, you must not steal or attack our services or try to take other users’ personal information. Essentially, be reasonable and responsible. Do not engage in any activity that could be harmful to Generate, our services, or our users. When using our services, you are responsible for your interactions with others. Generate does not control, and is not responsible for, any user’s actions.

Our services are always changing and evolving, and we may decide to make changes, impose limits, and occasionally suspend or terminate certain offerings. We can also suspend or terminate any individual account at any time for any reason.

Certain Services may enable you to specify the level at which such Services restrict access to your User Content. In such cases, you are solely responsible for applying the appropriate level of access to your User Content. If you do not choose, the system may default to its most permissive setting. You agree that Generate retains the right to create reasonable limits on Generate’s use and storage of the User Content, including your User Content, such as limits on file size, storage space, processing capacity, and similar limits described on the Services or otherwise determined by Generate in its sole discretion.

5.1 Fees. Certain products or services offered on or through the Services may be provided for a fee or other charge, including services or features for which access and use is purchased on a time limited basis (each a “Subscription”). You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. Our current pricing and payment terms are listed on the mobile application store or website of the authorized third party through which you have purchased a Subscription (“Distributor”). Generate may add new products and services for additional fees and charges, or amend fees and charges for existing products and services, at any time in its sole discretion. Any increased fees for existing Subscriptions will apply solely on a forward-looking basis beginning on your next billing period.

5.2 Payment. You may be required to provide Generate or the Distributor with information pertaining to a valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us or Distributor), PayPal account, or other permitted payment method (“Payment Information”). You agree that Generate or the Distributor, as applicable, is authorized to immediately charge your Payment Information for all fees and charges due and payable for the products and services hereunder and that, except as required under applicable law, no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately notify Generate or the applicable Distributor of any change in your billing address or Payment Information. Generate reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on the Services or by email delivery to you. Without limiting anything set forth therein, you acknowledge and agree that we may provide your Payment Information to our third party service providers (e.g., our payment processing partner) for use pursuant to our Privacy Policy.

5.3 Subscription. The fee for a Subscription will be billed by the Distributor or Generate at the start of your Subscription or, if applicable, at the end of any free trial period, and at regular intervals in accordance with your elections at the time of purchase. The timing of billing may change at any time. Your Subscription will continue to automatically renew indefinitely, including if you terminate your Account, until your Subscription is canceled in accordance with the Agreement. After your initial Subscription period, and again after any subsequent Subscription period, your Subscription will automatically renew on the first day following the end of such period (each a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent period at Generate’s then-current price for such Subscription. You agree that your Account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature (even if you otherwise terminate your Account) unless you cancel your Subscription prior to the Renewal Commencement Date in accordance with any terms between you and the Distributor. You may opt out of the auto-renewal of your Subscription, or cancel your Subscription, in the manner described at the link here. If you cancel your Subscription, such cancellation will be effective as of the end of your then-current Subscription term (the “Cancellation Date”), and your Subscription will not be renewed after such then-current term. You will not be eligible for a prorated refund from Generate of any portion of the fees paid for the then current period of your Subscription. By purchasing a Subscription, you authorize the applicable Distributor or Generate to charge your Payment Information in accordance with your selected Subscription plan. Upon renewal of your Subscription, if the applicable Distributor or Generate does not receive payment via your Payment Information, (a) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand and/or (b) you agree that Distributor or Generate may either cancel or suspend your Subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Information until payment is received.

5.4 Free Trials. Certain Subscription offerings may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method, the period of which will be communicated to you via the Services. If you decide to cancel your Subscription before Generate starts charging your payment method, you must cancel the Subscription before the free trial ends. Otherwise, you will be responsible for payment for the full term of the Subscription period.

As such, in no event will Generate be responsible for the actions or inactions of any Distributor or their third party payment service provider, including, but not limited to, system downtime or payment service outages, and any billing and fee disputes may require resolution between you and the Distributor or applicable third party. If you notify us of any fee or billing dispute we will likely direct you to the Distributor to address such dispute, but, to the extent we are able, we may assist you in resolving such dispute.

5.7 Taxes. The payments required under Section 5.1 of this Agreement do not include any Sales Tax that may be due in connection with the Services provided under this Agreement.

11. ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW.
Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Generate and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.

11.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any products sold or distributed through the Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with Generate, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (a) you may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (b) you or Generate may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.

You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

11.3 Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to: (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement; and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Generate. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.

11.4 Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND Generate HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Generate are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 11.1 above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

11.5 Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the Provincial or Federal Courts located in the Province of British Columbia and Country of Canada. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.

11.6 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: opt-out@Generateapp.com, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Generate username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.

11.7 Severability. Except as provided in subsection 11.5, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

11.8 Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Generate.

11.9 Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Generate makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing Generate at the following address: Suite 1600 Cathedral Place. 925 West Georgia Street. Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 3L2

Summary: This section describes how claims that you and we have against each other are resolved, including any claims that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this agreement. In particular, it requires disputes between us to be submitted to binding and final arbitration. Unless you opt out of the arbitration agreement, you will only be able to pursue claims and seek relief against us on an individual basis and you are waiving your right to seek relief in a court of law and to have a jury trial.

12.4 Limitation Period. YOU AND Generate AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TERMS, THE SERVICES OR THE CONTENT MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

12.5 Exclusive Venue. To the extent the parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Generate agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement will be litigated exclusively in the provincial or federal courts located in Vancouver, British Columbia.

12.6 Governing Law. THE TERMS AND ANY ACTION RELATED THERETO WILL BE GOVERNED AND INTERPRETED BY AND UNDER THE LAWS OF THE Province of British Columbia, CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY PRINCIPLES THAT PROVIDE FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS DOES NOT APPLY TO THE AGREEMENT.
12.7 Notice. Where Generate requires that you provide an email address, you are responsible for providing Generate with your most current email address. In the event that the last email address you provided to Generate is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by the Agreement, Generate’s dispatch of the email containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to Generate at the following address: 1500 Broadway, Attn: Legal,  Suite 1600 Cathedral Place. 925 West Georgia Street. Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 3L2.  Such notice shall be deemed given when received by Generate by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.

12.8 International Users. The Services are controlled and operated from its facilities in Canada. Generate makes no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Services from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export control, import, and trade sanctions regulations. 

12.9 Export Control. You may not use, export, import, or transfer the Services except as authorized by Canadian law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you obtained the Services, and any other applicable laws. In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported: (a) to any countries or territories subject to a Canadian. government embargo; or (b) to any individual or entity on the SDN List or Foreign Sanctions Evaders List maintained by OFAC or the Denied Persons List, Entity List, or Unverified List maintained by BIS (collectively, “Prohibited Party Lists”). By using the Services, you represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in an Embargoed Country; and (ii) you are not listed on any Prohibited Party Lists. You also will not use the Services for any purpose prohibited by Canadian law, including for the development, design, manufacture or production of missile, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.

12.10 Entire Agreement/Severability. This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Generate in connection with the Services, will constitute the entire agreement between you and Generate concerning the Services. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect. Headings are included for convenience only and will not be considered in interpreting this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, as used in this Agreement, the word including means including but not limited to.
12.11 No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Generate’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
12.12 App Stores. With respect to any Mobile Software accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (an “App Store Sourced Software”), you will only use the App Store Sourced Software (a) on an Apple-branded product that runs the iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system) and (b) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.

You agree to comply with all applicable United States and foreign laws related to use of the Mobile Software and the Services.
